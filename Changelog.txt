27-11-2016 update 0.1.1 "full working" row1 output(columnNr;rowNr) per time
27-11-2016 update 0.1.2 stub for row 1 and row2 together but has an error to display the wrong row. 
29-11-2016 update 0.1.2.3 "full working" row1 and row2 1char output, timer has to be added to switch from row1 to row2.
1-12-2016 update 0.1.2.4 The 0.1.2.4 update has a working row1() and row2() now. The bug that displayed a wrong row for a specific switch is fixed. It looks like the timer() routine is very slow. This makes it that the Serial Monitor doesn't display all keypresses.
3-12-2016 update 0.1.2.5 Radically new basic routine. Timer has gone and replaced by the loop() function. The code now uses matrices instead of different if loops for every key. The code does not however display one key per keypress. So a button pushed cecker has to be implemented.
16-12-2016 update 0.1.2.6 Layer matrix added, this is for a new way of handling witch modifier characters and keyboard layers. And it can display a charater in a wordprocessor like word or notepad instead of showing the coordinates of the key in the matrix on the Serial Monitor.
27-12-2016 update 0.1.2.7 Working one keypress at a time.
